## Problematic
How to identify the song my device is playing when I do not have access to its screen?

## Features
1. NotificationListenerService is used to spot music app notifications
2. The service to play media information can be switched on and off
3. Settings like play delay at start, play interval, play speed can be set
4. Ads can be detected and media info won't be played for those
